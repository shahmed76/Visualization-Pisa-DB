I selected Pisa database, and I had some questions in mind. 
1. What affects excelling students in reading, math and science? is it something related to their DNA such as gender? or is it the cultural background of their parents?
Or is it the wealth of their countries? or all of these factors?
2. Can students excel in one or two or three topics togther? which country achieved that?
3. Is Gender addressed in the countries? which had fairer education system?


Results:
1. When it comes to OECD countries, there is few participation of these countries and there is no much difference in math results when it comes to Gender except for Greece again, Portugal, Denmark and Netherlands, 
these countries also have a large sample. The less achievers in math in these countries may in fact reflect a high participation of them and not from other countries that belongs to OECD
2. When it comes to multi-talented. It seems that New Zealand is the only country that has all talents, and Singapore has more talents when two skills are combined together and it has significant number
3. It was found that boys did better in math, while girls did better in reading and both achieved the same in the science. Number of girls in the middle of the histogram was much higher than boys. It is possible that the missing data were connected to boys, and it is possible that some boys faild
4. The mean score of three topics are positively and strongly correlated with each others. This means if someone is excellent in one subject, he will be automatically good in other two subjects, but this is not true for top achiever thou. There is no significant observed when it comes to gender


I choose to include these points here, because they could andswer my questions that I had in mind when I started working in the project
